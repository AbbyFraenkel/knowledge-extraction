### 3. Review and Integration Process

1. **Peer Review Requirements**
   * All mathematical content requires review by Mathematical Content Specialist
   * All algorithms require review by Algorithm Specialist
   * All implementations require review by Implementation Developer
   * All knowledge graph entities require review by Knowledge Graph Architect

2. **Review Process**
   * Create review checklist for each content type
   * Document review outcomes with explicit approval
   * Track and resolve review comments
   * Require second review for complex or critical components

3. **Integration Workflow**
   * Merge reviewed content into main branch
   * Conduct integration testing after merges
   * Document integration decisions and rationales
   * Maintain audit trail of integration activities

## Version Control Strategy

### 1. Git Workflow

- **Branch Structure**
  * `main`: Stable, validated knowledge
  * `extract/[paper-id]`: Branches for specific paper extraction
  * `concept/[concept-name]`: Branches for specific mathematical concepts
  * `implement/[algorithm-name]`: Branches for specific implementations
  * `review/[component]`: Branches for review activities

- **Commit Guidelines**
  * Prefix commits with component type: `[MATH]`, `[ALG]`, `[IMPL]`, `[GRAPH]`, `[DOC]`
  * Include reference to source material: `[REF: Smith2020:p145]`
  * Keep mathematical content changes separate from implementation changes
  * Include brief description of mathematical significance

- **Pull Request Process**
  * Create detailed PR describing mathematical content
  * Include validation evidence (e.g., test results, comparisons)
  * Require approval from relevant specialists
  * Document resolution of review comments

### 2. Conflict Resolution

1. **Mathematical Content Conflicts**
   * Identify conflicting mathematical formulations
   * Compare against authoritative sources
   * Document reasons for adopted formulation
   * Record alternative formulations with context

2. **Implementation Conflicts**
   * Compare implementation approaches based on:
     * Fidelity to mathematical description
     * Performance characteristics
     * Maintainability and readability
     * Consistency with existing code
   * Document implementation decision rationale

3. **Escalation Path**
   * Team-level resolution as first attempt
   * Domain expert consultation for unresolved issues
   * Project lead final decision with documented rationale
   * External expert consultation for critical conflicts

## Communication Guidelines

### 1. Regular Meetings

- **Daily Stand-up**: 15-minute status update and coordination
- **Weekly Review**: Detailed progress review and planning
- **Bi-weekly Integration**: Focus on component integration and testing
- **Monthly Retrospective**: Process improvement and lessons learned

### 2. Documentation Standards

- **Work in Progress Documentation**
  * Maintain detailed notes on current extraction activities
  * Document partial results and intermediate steps
  * Note challenges, questions, and potential issues
  * Track connections to other team members' work
