# Legendre Polynomial Coefficient Decay Rate

## Overview

Legendre polynomial coefficient decay rate characterizes how quickly the coefficients in a Legendre polynomial expansion decrease as the degree increases. The decay rate parameter σ provides a quantitative measure of function smoothness, with higher values indicating smoother functions. For analytic functions, coefficients decay exponentially: |a_i| ≈ c⋅10^(-σi) where σ > 0 is the decay rate parameter and c is a constant.

## Mathematical Formulation

For a function f(x) defined on [-1,1], the Legendre polynomial expansion is given by:

```math
f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_i P_i(x)
```

Where P_i(x) is the i-th Legendre polynomial and a_i is the corresponding coefficient:

```math
a_i = \frac{2i+1}{2} \int_{-1}^{1} f(x) P_i(x) dx
```

The decay rate σ appears in the asymptotic behavior of these coefficients:

```math
|a_i| \approx c \cdot 10^{-\sigma i}
```

Where:
- $a_i$ represents the coefficient of the i-th Legendre polynomial
- $\sigma$ is the decay rate parameter
- $c$ is a constant

## Key Properties

- **Analyticity Indicator**: Functions with σ > 0 are analytic within some region
- **Smoothness Measure**: Higher values of σ indicate smoother functions
- **Convergence Rate**: Directly determines the convergence rate of spectral methods
- **Error Bounds**: Used to derive a priori error bounds for polynomial approximations
- **Singularity Detection**: Low values may indicate the presence of singularities

## Implementation Considerations

The decay rate can be estimated from computed Legendre coefficients:

```julia
function estimate_decay_rate(coeffs::Vector{Float64})
    n = length(coeffs)
    indices = 1:n

    # Take absolute values and avoid log(0)
    log_coeffs = log10.(max.(abs.(coeffs), 1e-16))

    # Linear regression to find slope (decay rate)
    A = [ones(n) indices]
    params = A \ log_coeffs

    # The decay rate is the negative of the slope
    decay_rate = -params[2]

    return decay_rate
end
```
