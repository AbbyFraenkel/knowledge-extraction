# Content Migration Framework

## Purpose and Goals

This framework outlines the approach, processes, and standards for migrating existing content across the knowledge extraction repositories to fully implement the symbol-concept separation architecture. The migration process ensures that all mathematical knowledge preserves original notation while enabling clean separation between symbols and concepts.

## Core Architectural Principles

The migration process is guided by these fundamental principles:

### 1. Symbol-Concept Separation

All migrated content must implement complete separation between:
- **Symbols**: The notation exactly as it appears in source papers
- **Concepts**: The underlying mathematical meaning independent of notation

This separation solves several critical challenges:
- Different authors using different symbols for the same concept
- The same symbol representing different concepts in different contexts
- Symbol meaning depending on specific paper context
- Mapping mathematical notation to implementation variables

### 2. Tiered Knowledge Organization

All migrated content must be organized into three tiers:
- **L1 (Core Knowledge)**: 100-200 word summaries of essential concepts
- **L2 (Functional Details)**: 500-1000 word explanations with full formulation
- **L3 (Complete Knowledge)**: 2000+ word comprehensive documentation

### 3. Cross-Domain Mapping

Migrated content must include explicit mappings between:
- Pure mathematical formulations and engineering applications
- Mathematical concepts and their Julia implementations
- Domain-specific interpretations of symbols

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Content Inventory and Assessment

1. **Content Discovery**
   - Systematically scan all repositories to identify content
   - Document location, type, and format of all content files
   - Categorize content by domain and subdomain

2. **Content Assessment**
   - Evaluate whether content follows symbol-concept separation
   - Assess completeness of mathematical formulations
   - Identify cross-domain relationships
   - Document symbol conflicts and inconsistencies

3. **Prioritization**
   - Identify KitchenSink-related content as highest priority
   - Prioritize fundamental concepts that many other concepts depend on
   - Prioritize content with cross-domain applications

### Phase 2: Template Application

1. **Symbol Registry Creation**
   - For each paper-based content, create a Symbol Registry using the template
   - Document all symbols with their LaTeX representation and context
   - Link symbols to their underlying concepts
   - Document any symbol conflicts

2. **Cypher File Generation**
   - Create Symbol Node files for all significant symbols
   - Create Concept Node files for mathematical concepts
   - Establish proper relationships between symbols and concepts
   - Document cross-domain interpretations

3. **Knowledge Reorganization**
   - Restructure content into the three-tier knowledge organization
   - Extract core knowledge (L1) for immediate context access
   - Organize detailed knowledge (L2) for common reference
   - Maintain comprehensive knowledge (L3) in dedicated files

### Phase 3: Cross-Reference Establishment

1. **Internal References**
   - Establish references between related concepts
   - Document hierarchical relationships (generalizes, specializes, etc.)
   - Link alternative formulations of the same concept

2. **Cross-Domain Mappings**
   - Create explicit mappings between mathematical and domain concepts
   - Document symbol interpretations across domains
   - Establish references between pure and applied content

3. **Implementation Connections**
   - Link mathematical concepts to Julia implementations
   - Document type relationships and architectural patterns
   - Establish mappings between mathematical symbols and code variables

### Phase 4: Validation and Quality Assurance

1. **Consistency Checking**
   - Verify that all symbols link to appropriate concepts
   - Check for unresolved symbol conflicts
   - Validate proper three-tier knowledge organization

2. **Completeness Verification**
   - Ensure all symbols have complete documentation
   - Verify all concepts have proper references and relationships
   - Check that all three knowledge tiers are properly populated

3. **Technical Review**
   - Conduct mathematical review of formulations
   - Verify correct LaTeX representation
   - Validate implementation connections

## Migration Templates and Standards

### Symbol Documentation Standard

All symbols must be documented following this standard:

```
Symbol: [Symbol as it appears]
LaTeX: [LaTeX representation]
Context: [Mathematical or application context]
Meaning: [Precise definition]
Dimensionality: [Scalar, Vector, Matrix, etc.]
Units: [Physical units if applicable]
Constraints: [Any mathematical constraints]
First Appearance: [Section, equation number]
```

### Concept Documentation Standard

All concepts must be documented following this standard:

```
Concept: [Concept name]
Definition: [L1 definition (100-200 words)]
Mathematical Formulation: [Key equations and mathematical properties]
Related Concepts: [Hierarchical and lateral relationships]
Cross-Domain Applications: [Domain-specific interpretations]
Implementation: [Connection to code implementation]
```

### Relationship Documentation Standard

All relationships must be documented following this standard:

```
Relation Type: [REPRESENTS, SPECIALIZES, IMPLEMENTS, etc.]
Source: [Source entity name]
Target: [Target entity name]
Context: [Specific context where the relationship applies]
Properties: [Any additional properties of the relationship]
Source: [Reference to literature or implementation]
```

## Usage and Extension

This framework should be used as the definitive guide for all content migration activities. As migration progresses, this document may be extended or refined based on insights gained during the process.

The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive, interconnected knowledge graph that preserves mathematical notation while enabling meaningful connections between concepts, implementations, and applications.
