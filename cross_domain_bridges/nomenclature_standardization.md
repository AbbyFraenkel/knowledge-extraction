# Nomenclature Standardization Bridge

## Overview

The Nomenclature Standardization Bridge provides systematic connections between mathematical notation used in theoretical domains and their applied counterparts. This system ensures consistent terminology and notation across pure and applied mathematics, facilitating knowledge transfer between domains while preserving domain-specific context and meaning.

## Mathematical Formulation

The bridge can be formalized as a mapping function:

```math
\mathcal{B}: (S_{source}, C_{source}) \rightarrow (S_{target}, C_{target})
```

Where:
- $S_{source}$ is the source notation (symbol, term, or expression)
- $C_{source}$ is the source context (domain, subdomain, or application)
- $S_{target}$ is the target notation
- $C_{target}$ is the target context

The mapping preserves semantic equivalence while adapting to target domain conventions:

```math
\text{Meaning}(S_{source}, C_{source}) \equiv \text{Meaning}(S_{target}, C_{target})
```

## Key Properties

- **Bidirectionality**: Mappings work in both directions between domains
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains appropriate context when transforming notation
- **Canonical References**: Provides canonical forms for cross-domain reference
- **Disambiguation**: Resolves conflicts when same symbol has different meanings
- **Transitive Consistency**: Maintains consistency across chains of transformations

## Implementation Considerations

The nomenclature standardization system requires careful management of symbolic conflicts:

```julia
function resolve_symbol_conflict(symbol::String, source_domain::String, target_domain::String)
    # Look up symbol in the mapping database
    mappings = query_symbol_mappings(symbol, source_domain, target_domain)

    if isempty(mappings)
        # No direct mapping exists
        canonical_symbol = get_canonical_form(symbol, source_domain)
        return canonical_symbol, "WARNING: No direct mapping to target domain"
    elseif length(mappings) == 1
        # Unique mapping exists
        return mappings[1].target_symbol, mappings[1].context_note
    else
        # Multiple mappings exist - ambiguity
        contexts = [m.context for m in mappings]
        symbols = [m.target_symbol for m in mappings]
        return symbols, "AMBIGUOUS: Multiple mappings based on context: $contexts"
    end
end
```
