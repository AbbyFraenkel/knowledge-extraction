# Document Processing

## Overview

This phase converts academic publications into structured knowledge assets with emphasis on preserving all mathematical content in complete form.

## Process Steps

### 1. Document Conversion and Analysis
- Convert PDF documents to markdown using `pdf-to-markdown({filepath: "paper.pdf"})`
- Ensure ALL equations remain in complete LaTeX format
- Extract key sections: abstract, methods, algorithms, results
- Identify core innovations and mathematical foundations
- Create complete catalog of all equations and algorithms with reference numbers

### 2. Mathematical Content Extraction
- **Create equation database**:
  * Extract every equation with section/page reference
  * Format: `{equation_id: "eq1", latex: "$$y(\\tau) \\approx Y(\\tau) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N} \\hat{a}_i P_i(\\tau)$$", section: "2.1", page: "1476"}`
- **Create algorithm database**:
  * Extract all algorithms with full steps
  * Format: `{algorithm_id: "alg1", name: "hp-Legendre Algorithm", steps: [...], section: "5", page: "1479"}`
- **Create numerical methods database**:
  * Document all numerical methods with implementation details
  * Format: `{method_id: "method1", name: "Legendre Coefficient Analysis", description: "...", key_equations: ["eq1", "eq2"], section: "2.2"}`

### 3. Content Categorization
- Categorize content into:
  * Core concepts and definitions
  * Mathematical formulations
  * Algorithms and procedures
  * Implementation considerations
  * Validation methods and results
  * Application domains

### 4. Reference Indexing
- Create a reference index linking concepts to specific sections/pages
- Format: `{concept: "concept name", source: "paper title", section: "3.2", pages: "8-10"}`
- Generate citation metadata for future referencing

## Available Tools

### Document Processing Functions
- `pdf-to-markdown`: Convert PDF files to markdown format
- `docx-to-markdown`: Convert Word documents to markdown
- `pptx-to-markdown`: Convert PowerPoint presentations to markdown
- `image-to-markdown`: Process figures and diagrams
- `youtube-to-markdown`: Extract content from video presentations
- `webpage-to-markdown`: Capture web-based content
- `convert-contents`: Transform between different formats

## Critical Requirements

- **ALL mathematical content must be preserved in its complete form**
- Every equation must be extracted in full LaTeX format
- All variables, parameters, and symbols must be preserved with original notation
- Both inline and display equations must be captured
- Special formatting (e.g., bold, script, etc.) must be maintained
