# Cross-Domain Integration

## Overview

This phase establishes methods for connecting knowledge across different domains, particularly between computer vision, numerical methods, and applications. These connections enable efficient knowledge transfer and usage in interdisciplinary projects.

## Process Steps

### 1. Bridge Entity Creation
- Use Cypher CREATE statements to create cross-domain bridge entities:
  ```cypher
  CREATE (bridge:CrossDomainBridge:Entity {
    name: "bridge name",
    description: "connects domain X to domain Y",
    transformation_process: "description of the transformation process",
    applications: ["application1", "application2"]
  })
  ```
  * Required attributes: source domain, target domain, transformation process
  * Optional attributes: limitations, prerequisites, examples

### 2. Cross-Domain Relationship Mapping
- Use Cypher MATCH/CREATE to establish cross-domain relationships:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (source:Entity {name: "Source Entity"}),
        (target:Entity {name: "Target Entity"})
  CREATE (source)-[:TRANSFORMS_TO]->(target)
  ```
  * Transformation relationships: `TRANSFORMS_TO`, `MAPS_BETWEEN`, `TRANSLATES_FROM`
  * Adaptation relationships: `ADAPTS_FOR`, `SPECIALIZED_AS`, `GENERALIZED_FROM`
  * Combination relationships: `COMBINES_WITH`, `ENHANCES`, `CONSTRAINS`

### 3. Knowledge Flow Definition
- Document the process by which knowledge from one domain influences another
- Create explicit mapping between terminology and concepts
- Document transformation of mathematical formulations
- Define information flow patterns and prerequisites

## Tiered Knowledge Representation

To optimize context window usage while preserving depth:

### 1. L1: Cross-Domain Summaries (100-200 words)
- Essential connection between domains
- Key transformation processes
- Primary applications of the integration
- Related concept references

### 2. L2: Integration Procedures (500-1000 words)
- Formal definition of the cross-domain mapping
- Algorithmic approach to data transformation
- Implementation considerations
- Validation methods

### 3. L3: Complete Integration Knowledge (2000+ words)
- Mathematical derivations of transformations
- Complete algorithm implementations
- Error propagation analysis
- Benchmark results
- Application case studies

## Available Tools

### Knowledge Graph Cypher Operations
- `CREATE`: Create nodes and relationships in the knowledge graph
- `MATCH`: Find nodes and patterns in the knowledge graph
- `WHERE`: Filter query results based on conditions
- `RETURN`: Specify data to be returned from queries
- `MERGE`: Create nodes/relationships if they don't exist, or match them if they do

## Example

```cypher
// Create a cross-domain bridge between computer vision and fluid dynamics
CREATE (bridge:CrossDomainBridge:Entity {
  name: 'Optical Flow to CFD Boundary Conditions',
  path: 'cross_domain_bridges/vision_to_numerics/optical_flow_to_cfd',
  tier1_knowledge: 'Transforms optical flow vector fields from video data into boundary conditions for CFD simulations. Applies physics constraints to ensure conservation properties. Requires camera calibration and coordinate transformation. Enables non-intrusive measurement of complex fluid flows.',
  file_references: 'FILE:cross_domain_bridges/vision_to_numerics/optical_flow_to_cfd.md'
});

// Establish the cross-domain relationships
MATCH (bridge:CrossDomainBridge {name: 'Optical Flow to CFD Boundary Conditions'})
MATCH (technique:VisualTechnique {name: 'Physics-Informed Optical Flow'})
CREATE (bridge)-[:USES_TECHNIQUE]->(technique);

MATCH (bridge:CrossDomainBridge {name: 'Optical Flow to CFD Boundary Conditions'})
MATCH (boundary:PhysicalApplication {name: 'Free Surface Boundary Conditions'})
CREATE (bridge)-[:PROVIDES_INPUT_FOR]->(boundary);

// Document the knowledge flow
CREATE (flow:KnowledgeFlow:Entity {
  name: 'Optical Flow to CFD Knowledge Flow',
  source_domain: 'computer_vision',
  source_concept: 'optical_flow',
  source_representation: 'pixel velocity field (u,v)'
});

// Add transformation steps
CREATE (transform:Transformation:Entity {
  name: 'Optical Flow to CFD Transformation',
  steps: [
    'Apply physics constraints (mass conservation)',
    'Transform from image to physical coordinates',
    'Scale velocities to physical units',
    'Filter noise using temporal consistency'
  ]
});

// Add target information
CREATE (target:Target:Entity {
  name: 'CFD Boundary Conditions Target',
  domain: 'fluid_dynamics',
  concept: 'boundary_conditions',
  representation: 'physical velocity field and surface height'
});

// Add validation methods
CREATE (validation:Validation:Entity {
  name: 'Optical Flow to CFD Validation',
  methods: ['Comparison with PIV measurements', 'Conservation properties'],
  error_metrics: ['RMSE', 'Conservation violation']
});

// Connect the knowledge flow components
MATCH (bridge:CrossDomainBridge {name: 'Optical Flow to CFD Boundary Conditions'})
MATCH (flow:KnowledgeFlow {name: 'Optical Flow to CFD Knowledge Flow'})
MATCH (transform:Transformation {name: 'Optical Flow to CFD Transformation'})
MATCH (target:Target {name: 'CFD Boundary Conditions Target'})
MATCH (validation:Validation {name: 'Optical Flow to CFD Validation'})

CREATE (bridge)-[:DOCUMENTS]->(flow)
CREATE (flow)-[:HAS_TRANSFORMATION]->(transform)
CREATE (flow)-[:HAS_TARGET]->(target)
CREATE (flow)-[:HAS_VALIDATION]->(validation);
```

## Integration Examples Repository

Maintain a repository of integration examples:

```
/cross-domain-examples/
  /vision-to-numerics/
    optical-flow-to-cfd.md
    image-segmentation-to-mesh-generation.md
  /numerics-to-control/
    pde-solver-to-mpc.md
    optimization-to-optimal-control.md
  /vision-to-applications/
    vision-to-parameter-estimation.md
```

Each example should document:
1. The source and target domains
2. The mapping process (with equations)
3. Implementation considerations
4. Validation approach
5. Error handling
6. Example code
