# Cross-Domain Integration

## Overview

This phase establishes methods for connecting knowledge across different domains, particularly between computer vision, numerical methods, and applications. These connections enable efficient knowledge transfer and usage in interdisciplinary projects.

## Process Steps

### 1. Bridge Entity Creation
- Use `create_entities({entities: [...]})` to create cross-domain bridge entities:
  * Format: `{name: "bridge name", entityType: "CrossDomainBridge", observations: ["connects domain X to domain Y", "transformation process", "applications"]}`
  * Required attributes: source domain, target domain, transformation process
  * Optional attributes: limitations, prerequisites, examples

### 2. Cross-Domain Relationship Mapping
- Use `create_relations({relations: [...]})` to establish cross-domain relationships:
  * Transformation: `transforms_to`, `maps_between`, `translates_from`
  * Adaptation: `adapts_for`, `specialized_as`, `generalized_from`
  * Combination: `combines_with`, `enhances`, `constrains`

### 3. Knowledge Flow Definition
- Document the process by which knowledge from one domain influences another
- Create explicit mapping between terminology and concepts
- Document transformation of mathematical formulations
- Define information flow patterns and prerequisites

## Tiered Knowledge Representation

To optimize context window usage while preserving depth:

### 1. L1: Cross-Domain Summaries (100-200 words)
- Essential connection between domains
- Key transformation processes
- Primary applications of the integration
- Related concept references

### 2. L2: Integration Procedures (500-1000 words)
- Formal definition of the cross-domain mapping
- Algorithmic approach to data transformation
- Implementation considerations
- Validation methods

### 3. L3: Complete Integration Knowledge (2000+ words)
- Mathematical derivations of transformations
- Complete algorithm implementations
- Error propagation analysis
- Benchmark results
- Application case studies

## Available Tools

### Knowledge Graph Functions
- `create_entities`: Create bridge entities in the knowledge graph
- `create_relations`: Establish cross-domain relationships
- `search_nodes`: Search for entities across multiple domains
- `open_nodes`: Access specific bridge nodes by name

## Example

```javascript
// Create a cross-domain bridge between computer vision and fluid dynamics
createEntities({
  entities: [
    {
      name: "Optical Flow to CFD Boundary Conditions",
      entityType: "CrossDomainBridge",
      observations: [
        "Transforms optical flow vector fields from video data into boundary conditions for CFD simulations",
        "Applies physics constraints to ensure conservation properties",
        "Requires camera calibration and coordinate transformation",
        "Enables non-intrusive measurement of complex fluid flows"
      ]
    }
  ]
});

// Establish the cross-domain relationships
createRelations({
  relations: [
    {
      from: "Optical Flow to CFD Boundary Conditions",
      to: "Physics-Informed Optical Flow", 
      relationType: "uses_technique"
    },
    {
      from: "Optical Flow to CFD Boundary Conditions",
      to: "Free Surface Boundary Conditions",
      relationType: "provides_input_for"
    }
  ]
});

// Document the knowledge flow
const knowledgeFlow = {
  source: {
    domain: "computer_vision",
    concept: "optical_flow",
    representation: "pixel velocity field (u,v)"
  },
  transformation: [
    "Apply physics constraints (mass conservation)",
    "Transform from image to physical coordinates",
    "Scale velocities to physical units",
    "Filter noise using temporal consistency"
  ],
  target: {
    domain: "fluid_dynamics",
    concept: "boundary_conditions",
    representation: "physical velocity field and surface height"
  },
  validation: {
    methods: ["Comparison with PIV measurements", "Conservation properties"],
    error_metrics: ["RMSE", "Conservation violation"]
  }
};
```

## Integration Examples Repository

Maintain a repository of integration examples:

```
/cross-domain-examples/
  /vision-to-numerics/
    optical-flow-to-cfd.md
    image-segmentation-to-mesh-generation.md
  /numerics-to-control/
    pde-solver-to-mpc.md
    optimization-to-optimal-control.md
  /vision-to-applications/
    vision-to-parameter-estimation.md
```

Each example should document:
1. The source and target domains
2. The mapping process (with equations)
3. Implementation considerations
4. Validation approach
5. Error handling
6. Example code
