# Knowledge Graph Construction

## Overview

This phase transforms structured content into interconnected knowledge entities in Atlas, establishing a queryable graph of mathematical concepts, equations, algorithms, and their relationships.

## Process Steps

### 1. Mathematical Entity Creation
- Use Cypher CREATE statements to create mathematical concept entities:
  * Standard format:
  ```cypher
  CREATE (c:MathematicalConcept:Entity {
    name: "concept name",
    description: "formal definition",
    properties: ["property1", "property2"],
    applications: ["application1", "application2"]
  })
  ```
  * Required attributes: formal definition, key properties, reference index
  * Optional attributes: historical context, limitations, alternatives

- Create equation entities:
  * Format:
  ```cypher
  CREATE (e:MathematicalEquation:Entity {
    name: "Equation X",
    latex_representation: "\\hat{e} = \\frac{c10^{-\\sigma(N+1)}}{\\sqrt{1-10^{-2\\sigma}}}",
    explanation: "Explanation of terms",
    context: "Usage context"
  })
  ```

- Create algorithm/method entities:
  * Format:
  ```cypher
  CREATE (a:Algorithm:Entity {
    name: "algorithm name",
    purpose: "algorithm purpose",
    steps: ["step1", "step2", "step3"],
    complexity: "O(n log n)"
  })
  ```
  * Required attributes: inputs, outputs, pseudocode, complexity
  * Optional attributes: convergence properties, stability conditions

- Create numerical method entities:
  * Format:
  ```cypher
  CREATE (nm:NumericalMethod:Entity {
    name: "method name",
    mathematical_foundation: "underlying theory",
    implementation_details: "key implementation aspects",
    error_analysis: "error bounds and behavior"
  })
  ```

- Create application entities:
  * Format:
  ```cypher
  CREATE (app:Application:Entity {
    name: "application name",
    domain: "application domain",
    benefits: ["benefit1", "benefit2"],
    implementation: "implementation approach"
  })
  ```

### 2. Relationship Mapping
- Use Cypher MATCH/CREATE to establish relationships:
  * Mathematical dependencies: `MATCH (a), (b) WHERE a.name = "X" AND b.name = "Y" CREATE (a)-[:DERIVES_FROM]->(b)`
  * Hierarchical: `MATCH (a), (b) WHERE a.name = "X" AND b.name = "Y" CREATE (a)-[:IS_A]->(b)`
  * Implementation: `MATCH (a), (b) WHERE a.name = "X" AND b.name = "Y" CREATE (a)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(b)`
  * Comparative: `MATCH (a), (b) WHERE a.name = "X" AND b.name = "Y" CREATE (a)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(b)`

### 3. Knowledge Graph Validation
- Use Cypher MATCH queries to verify completeness of the graph
- Verify that ALL equations and algorithms are represented:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (e:MathematicalEquation) RETURN count(e) AS EquationCount
  MATCH (a:Algorithm) RETURN count(a) AS AlgorithmCount
  ```
- Verify connectivity: no isolated nodes or clusters:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (n) WHERE NOT (n)--() RETURN n.name AS IsolatedNodes
  ```
- Verify accuracy: relationships match paper's descriptions
- Verify retrievability: all nodes have clear access paths

## Available Tools

### Knowledge Graph Cypher Operations
- `CREATE`: Create entities and relationships in the knowledge graph
- `MATCH`: Find nodes and patterns in the knowledge graph
- `WHERE`: Filter query results based on conditions
- `RETURN`: Specify data to be returned from queries
- `MERGE`: Create entities if they don't exist, or match them if they do
- `DELETE`: Remove entities or relationships from the graph
- `SET`: Update properties on nodes and relationships

## Example

```cypher
// Create mathematical concept entities
CREATE (decay:MathematicalProperty:Entity {
  name: "Legendre Polynomial Coefficient Decay Rate",
  description: "Characterizes how quickly Legendre polynomial coefficients decrease",
  indicator: "Indicates function smoothness when rate exceeds threshold",
  formal_definition: "Formally defined as parameter σ in |a_i| ≈ c⋅10^(-σi)"
});

// Add equation entity with full LaTeX
CREATE (error:MathematicalEquation:Entity {
  name: "Error Bound Equation",
  latex_representation: "\\hat{e} = \\frac{c10^{-\\sigma(N+1)}}{\\sqrt{1-10^{-2\\sigma}}}",
  explanation: "Where σ is the decay rate parameter",
  application: "This provides an upper bound on the approximation error"
});

// Create relationship between concept and equation
MATCH (decay:MathematicalProperty {name: "Legendre Polynomial Coefficient Decay Rate"}),
      (error:MathematicalEquation {name: "Error Bound Equation"})
CREATE (error)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(decay);
```
