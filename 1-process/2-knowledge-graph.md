# Knowledge Graph Construction

## Overview

This phase transforms structured content into interconnected knowledge entities in Atlas, establishing a queryable graph of mathematical concepts, equations, algorithms, and their relationships.

## Process Steps

### 1. Mathematical Entity Creation
- Use `create_entities({entities: [...]})` to create mathematical concept entities:
  * Standard format: `{name: "concept name", entityType: "MathematicalConcept", observations: ["definition", "properties", "applications"]}`
  * Required attributes: formal definition, key properties, reference index
  * Optional attributes: historical context, limitations, alternatives

- Create equation entities:
  * Format: `{name: "Equation X", entityType: "MathematicalEquation", observations: ["Full LaTeX representation", "Explanation of terms", "Usage context"]}`

- Create algorithm/method entities:
  * Format: `{name: "algorithm name", entityType: "Algorithm", observations: ["purpose", "steps", "complexity"]}`
  * Required attributes: inputs, outputs, pseudocode, complexity
  * Optional attributes: convergence properties, stability conditions

- Create numerical method entities:
  * Format: `{name: "method name", entityType: "NumericalMethod", observations: ["mathematical foundation", "implementation details", "error analysis"]}`

- Create application entities:
  * Format: `{name: "application name", entityType: "Application", observations: ["domain", "benefits", "implementation"]}`

### 2. Relationship Mapping
- Use `create_relations({relations: [...]})` to establish relationships:
  * Mathematical dependencies: `derives_from`, `is_equivalent_to`, `approximates`
  * Hierarchical: `is_a`, `type_of`, `subclass_of`, `instance_of`
  * Implementation: `implements`, `realizes`, `extends`, `optimizes`
  * Comparative: `similar_to`, `different_from`, `improves_upon`, `alternative_to`

### 3. Knowledge Graph Validation
- Use `read_graph({})` to verify completeness of the graph
- Verify that ALL equations and algorithms are represented
- Verify connectivity: no isolated nodes or clusters
- Verify accuracy: relationships match paper's descriptions
- Verify retrievability: all nodes have clear access paths

## Available Tools

### Knowledge Graph Functions
- `create_entities`: Create entities in the knowledge graph
- `create_relations`: Establish relationships between entities
- `read_graph`: Retrieve the entire knowledge graph
- `search_nodes`: Search for specific nodes in the knowledge graph
- `open_nodes`: Access specific nodes by name

## Example

```javascript
// Create mathematical concept entities
createEntities({
  entities: [
    {
      name: "Legendre Polynomial Coefficient Decay Rate",
      entityType: "MathematicalProperty",
      observations: [
        "Characterizes how quickly Legendre polynomial coefficients decrease",
        "Indicates function smoothness when rate exceeds threshold",
        "Formally defined as parameter σ in |a_i| ≈ c⋅10^(-σi)"
      ]
    },
    // Add equation entity with full LaTeX
    {
      name: "Error Bound Equation",
      entityType: "MathematicalEquation",
      observations: [
        "The error bound is given by: $$\\hat{e} = \\frac{c10^{-\\sigma(N+1)}}{\\sqrt{1-10^{-2\\sigma}}}$$",
        "Where σ is the decay rate parameter",
        "This provides an upper bound on the approximation error"
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```
