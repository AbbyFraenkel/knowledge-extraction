# Cross-Domain Integration

## Overview

This phase establishes methods for connecting knowledge across different domains, particularly between computer vision, numerical methods, and applications. These connections enable efficient knowledge transfer and usage in interdisciplinary projects.

## Process Steps

### 1. Bridge Entity Creation
- Use Cypher CREATE statements to create cross-domain bridge entities:
  ```cypher
  CREATE (bridge:CrossDomainBridge:Entity {
    name: "bridge name",
    description: "connects domain X to domain Y",
    transformation_process: "description of the transformation process",
    applications: ["application1", "application2"]
  })
  ```
  * Required attributes: source domain, target domain, transformation process
  * Optional attributes: limitations, prerequisites, examples

### 2. Cross-Domain Relationship Mapping
- Use Cypher MATCH/CREATE to establish cross-domain relationships:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (source:Entity {name: "Source Entity"}),
        (target:Entity {name: "Target Entity"})
  CREATE (source)-[:TRANSFORMS_TO]->(target)
  ```
  * Transformation relationships: `TRANSFORMS_TO`, `MAPS_BETWEEN`, `TRANSLATES_FROM`
  * Adaptation relationships: `ADAPTS_FOR`, `SPECIALIZED_AS`, `GENERALIZED_FROM`
  * Combination relationships: `COMBINES_WITH`, `ENHANCES`, `CONSTRAINS`

### 3. Knowledge Flow Definition
- Document the process by which knowledge from one domain influences another
- Create explicit mapping between terminology and concepts
- Document transformation of mathematical formulations
- Define information flow patterns and prerequisites

## Available Tools

### Knowledge Graph Cypher Operations
- `CREATE`: Create nodes and relationships in the knowledge graph
- `MATCH`: Find nodes and patterns in the knowledge graph
- `WHERE`: Filter query results based on conditions
- `RETURN`: Specify data to be returned from queries
- `MERGE`: Create nodes/relationships if they don't exist, or match them if they do

## Example

```cypher
// Create a cross-domain bridge between mathematics and engineering
CREATE (bridge:CrossDomainBridge:Entity {
  name: 'Orthogonal Collocation to Heat Transfer',
  path: 'cross_domain_bridges/mathematics_to_engineering/orthogonal_collocation_to_heat_transfer',
  tier1_knowledge: 'Maps mathematical spectral discretization techniques to engineering heat transfer applications. Enables high-accuracy temperature profile modeling with excellent convergence properties. Particularly useful for steep gradients and complex geometries in pasteurization processes.',
  file_references: 'FILE:cross_domain_bridges/mathematics_to_engineering/orthogonal_collocation_to_heat_transfer.md'
});

// Establish the cross-domain relationships
MATCH (bridge:CrossDomainBridge {name: 'Orthogonal Collocation to Heat Transfer'})
MATCH (method:MathematicalConcept {name: 'Orthogonal Collocation'})
CREATE (bridge)-[:USES_TECHNIQUE]->(method);

MATCH (bridge:CrossDomainBridge {name: 'Orthogonal Collocation to Heat Transfer'})
MATCH (application:ApplicationDomain {name: 'Thermal Engineering'})
CREATE (bridge)-[:PROVIDES_SOLUTION_FOR]->(application);

// Document the knowledge flow
CREATE (flow:KnowledgeFlow:Entity {
  name: 'Math to Heat Transfer Knowledge Flow',
  source_domain: 'numerical_methods',
  source_concept: 'orthogonal_collocation',
  source_representation: 'basis functions and collocation points'
});

// Add transformation steps
CREATE (transform:Transformation:Entity {
  name: 'Math to Heat Transfer Transformation',
  steps: [
    'Map basis functions to temperature profile representations',
    'Transform collocation points to critical locations in container',
    'Connect convergence properties to pasteurization accuracy requirements',
    'Map error estimation to food safety validation'
  ]
});

// Add target information
CREATE (target:Target:Entity {
  name: 'Heat Transfer Target',
  domain: 'thermal_engineering',
  concept: 'temperature_distribution',
  representation: 'pasteurization temperature profiles in containers'
});

// Connect the knowledge flow components
MATCH (bridge:CrossDomainBridge {name: 'Orthogonal Collocation to Heat Transfer'})
MATCH (flow:KnowledgeFlow {name: 'Math to Heat Transfer Knowledge Flow'})
MATCH (transform:Transformation {name: 'Math to Heat Transfer Transformation'})
MATCH (target:Target {name: 'Heat Transfer Target'})

CREATE (bridge)-[:DOCUMENTS]->(flow)
CREATE (flow)-[:HAS_TRANSFORMATION]->(transform)
CREATE (flow)-[:HAS_TARGET]->(target);
```

## Integration Examples Repository

Integration examples should be organized following this structure:

```
/cross-domain-examples/
  /mathematics-to-engineering/
    orthogonal-collocation-to-heat-transfer.md
    adaptive-refinement-to-moving-boundaries.md
  /numerical-methods-to-food-safety/
    temperature-modeling-to-pasteurization-units.md
    error-analysis-to-process-validation.md
  /optimization-to-applications/
    mathematical-optimization-to-energy-efficiency.md
    constrained-optimization-to-process-control.md
```

Each example should document:
1. The source and target domains
2. The mapping process (with equations)
3. Implementation considerations
4. Validation approach
5. Error handling
6. Example code or pseudocode

## Symbol Mapping Guidelines

When mapping mathematical symbols to application domains:

1. **Create explicit mappings** that preserve the original mathematical meaning
2. **Document domain-specific units** and their relationship to dimensionless parameters
3. **Include typical value ranges** for the parameters in the application domain
4. **Describe measurement or determination methods** for each parameter
5. **Note domain-specific constraints** or considerations that affect interpretation
6. **Provide implementation guidance** for translating between mathematical and engineering representations

## KitchenSink Integration Examples

For the KitchenSink solver, create explicit mappings such as:

```
| Mathematical Symbol | KitchenSink Implementation |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Φⱼᵏ(x) | OrthogonalBasis{T}(j, k, x) |
| ξᵢ | collocation_points[i] |
| ▽² | laplacian_operator() |
| ε | error_tolerance |
```

Include comprehensive implementation details:
1. Type hierarchies for mathematical concepts
2. Function signatures with type specifications
3. Performance considerations and optimizations
4. Testing and validation procedures

## Validation Methods

Each cross-domain mapping should include validation methods:

1. **Mathematical validation**: Ensure the mapping preserves relevant mathematical properties
2. **Dimensional consistency**: Verify that units and dimensions are correctly transformed
3. **Boundary and limit behavior**: Test the mapping at boundary conditions and limiting cases
4. **Implementation testing**: Provide specific test cases that verify correct implementation
5. **Application benchmarks**: Validate against known problems or experimental data in the application domain
