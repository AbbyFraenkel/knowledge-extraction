# Knowledge Extraction System

## Overview

This system provides a comprehensive framework for extracting, organizing, and implementing academic knowledge with special emphasis on mathematical content, algorithms, and numerical methods.

## Directory Structure

- **1-process/**: Detailed workflow phases for knowledge extraction
  - `1-document-processing.md`: Converting publications to structured formats
  - `2-knowledge-graph.md`: Creating and managing knowledge relationships
  - `3-implementation-repo.md`: Building implementation repositories
  - `4-integration-pathways.md`: Integrating with existing packages
  - `5-knowledge-retrieval.md`: Accessing and utilizing extracted knowledge

- **2-templates/**: Domain-specific extraction templates
  - `AbstractAlgebraTemplate.md`: For algebraic structures and operations
  - `DifferentialGeometryTemplate.md`: For manifolds and geometric structures
  - `DynamicalSystemsTemplate.md`: For continuous and discrete dynamical systems
  - `NumericalOptimizationTemplate.md`: For optimization algorithms and methods

- **3-examples/**: Complete worked examples
  - `spectral-method.md`: Spectral method implementation example
  - `multi-level-ocfc.md`: Multi-level OCFC algorithm extraction
  - `conservation-properties.md`: Conservation properties verification
  - `lorenz-system.md`: Complex physical system example
  - `boundary-value-problem.md`: Boundary value problem with multiple methods

- **4-guidelines/**: Standards and procedures
  - `nomenclature-system.md`: Terminology standardization
  - `validation-checklist.md`: Quality verification procedures
  - `collaborative-workflow.md`: Team coordination guidelines
  - `mathematics-visualization.md`: Guidelines for visual mathematical content

## Core Principles

1. **Mathematical Fidelity**: Preserve all equations, algorithms, and numerical methods in complete form
2. **Structured Knowledge**: Organize content into interconnected knowledge graphs
3. **Implementation Focus**: Ensure theoretical concepts have practical implementations
4. **Integration Ready**: Provide clear pathways to integrate with existing codebases

## Getting Started

1. Choose the appropriate template from `2-templates/` for your domain
2. Follow the extraction process outlined in `1-process/`
3. Use the examples in `3-examples/` as references
4. Validate your extraction using the checklist in `4-guidelines/validation-checklist.md`

## Key Features

- Complete preservation of mathematical content
- Multi-tiered knowledge organization
- Integrated implementation repositories
- Clear integration pathways
- Standardized validation procedures
