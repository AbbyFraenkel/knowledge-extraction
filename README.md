# Knowledge Extraction System

## Overview

This system provides a comprehensive framework for extracting, organizing, and implementing academic knowledge with special emphasis on mathematical content, algorithms, and numerical methods. The system supports interdisciplinary knowledge integration across numerics, computer vision, control systems, and data science domains.

## Core Principles

1. **Mathematical Fidelity**: Preserve all equations, algorithms, and numerical methods in complete form
2. **Structured Knowledge**: Organize content into interconnected knowledge graphs
3. **Implementation Focus**: Ensure theoretical concepts have practical implementations
4. **Integration Ready**: Provide clear pathways to integrate with existing codebases
5. **Cross-Domain Connectivity**: Enable knowledge transfer between different domains

## Knowledge Organization

The `knowledge-taxonomy.md` file defines the comprehensive structure for organizing knowledge across domains:

- **Numerics**: Differential equations, discretization methods, optimization algorithms, etc.
- **Computer Vision**: Image processing, feature extraction, physics-informed vision, etc.
- **Applications**: Control systems, fluid dynamics, parameter estimation, etc.
- **Cross-Domain Bridges**: Connecting concepts across different domains

Each domain uses a three-tiered knowledge representation to optimize context window usage:
- **L1**: Core concepts (100-200 words)
- **L2**: Functional details (500-1000 words)
- **L3**: Complete knowledge (2000+ words)

## Getting Started

1. Choose the appropriate template from `2-templates/` for your domain
2. Follow the extraction process outlined in `1-process/`
3. Use the examples in `3-examples/` as references
4. Validate your extraction using the checklist in `4-guidelines/validation-checklist.md`
5. Organize knowledge according to the taxonomy in `knowledge-taxonomy.md`
6. Create cross-domain connections as needed using `cross-domain-integration.md` guidelines

## Key Features

- Complete preservation of mathematical content
- Multi-tiered knowledge organization for context optimization
